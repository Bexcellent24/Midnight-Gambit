# Midnight Gambit

*Midnight Gambit* is a high-stakes game of chance and strategy, built in Unreal Engine during the **SA Game Jam 2024**.  
Created in just 48 hours under the theme *Midnight Staircase*, the game challenges players to wager souls, gamble with dice, and climb a mysterious staircase where every choice could lead you higher or drag you deeper down.  

## Gameplay
You wager souls to climb a staircase filled with peril and chance.  
- On **Level 1**, two doors await. Each choice requires a wager of souls:  
  - **1 soul** â€“ Pick a door, move up or down 1 level  
  - **2 souls** â€“ Roll a d4, move up or down that number of levels  
  - **3 souls** â€“ Roll a d6, move up or down that number of levels  
- As you climb, the number of doors increases â€” but only one leads upward  
- Lose all your souls and the game ends  
- Reach the top floor to win  

Every third level features an **arcade riddle machine**:  
- Answer correctly to earn a bonus  
- Choose to either remove one false door or gain more souls to gamble with  

## Features
- Unique **risk vs reward** gameplay loop  
- Dice-based mechanics tied to soul betting  
- A mocking narrator that reacts to your failures  
- Riddle machines with optional rewards  
- Randomised progression â€” the correct door changes every time
